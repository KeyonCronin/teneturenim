example-dotnet-grpc-client
==========================

A gRPC client in dotnet, generated from protobuf. 
This project is only here for comparing public APIs and experimenting with gRPC.

The client can be run against one of the example gRPC servers:
- example-node-grpc-backend-server (grpc-backend)
- example-node-grpc-server (@grpc/grpc-js)
- example-dotnet-grpc-server (dotnet)
