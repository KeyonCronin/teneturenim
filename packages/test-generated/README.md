@protobuf-ts/test-generated
===========================

Automated tests for code generated by the protobuf-ts plugin. 

| Test name     | optimize_for  | 64 bit number representation  |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| speed         | speed         |                        string |
| size          | code size     |                        string |
| speed-bigint  | speed         |                        bigint |
| size-bigint   | code size     |                        bigint |


Each test validates:
- the special JSON representation of well-known types
- custom utility methods like `Timestamp.toDate()` of well-known types
- compatibility of binary encoding via reflection and via generated code
- equality of generated field information with fixture data
- presence (and exclusion) of custom field options in generated code
- presence (and exclusion) of custom service and method options in generated code
- binary and JSON format conformance, using googles [conformance test runner](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/3.12.x/conformance/README.md) 
- functionality of generated RPC method styles

Each test is run in node as well as a headless browser.

`@protobuf-ts/plugin-framework`, `@protobuf-ts/plugin` and `@protobuf-ts/runtime` 
must be built to run the tests. `make` executes all tests. See `Makefile` 
for details.
